## Contracts

- [Hello World](./contracts/HelloWorld.sol): A simple hello world contract that can be used to test the setting up of the environemnt.

## Development Setup and Running the App

We are using `hardhat` to setup a local test network on which we would be running the application.

1. Compile the contracts by running `npx hardhat compile.`

## Key features of the Application

### Client

### Developer

- Developed in 100% TypeScript to ensure type-safety.
- Accompanied with testing in the [test](./test/) directory. You can ensure that the contracts are working correcting by running the `npx hardhat test` command in the root of the project. We are using `chai` as the test runner.
