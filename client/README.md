# Client

This folder contains all the client side code for the platform. This is built with the help of React and Material UI.

We are primarliy using two context providers, `useContract` and `useMetaMask` to get access to the all the Web3 integration throughout the app. Also this project has the [`data/contracts`](./src/data/contracts/) directory, which is automatallically generated during deployment.
